##What It Is
---
This is a React Project to refine my skills using React and Redux. This is a simple checkers game to practice logic.

##What We Used
---
  * HTML5
  * CSS3
  * JavaScript
  * ReactJS
  * Redux

##Challenges and Solutions
---
Simple checkers game

  * Challenge #1: Game checks
    Creating a game is 


  More challenges to come as I continue to program

<!-- This is the player constructor function we use for creating each new player on the canvas game board. It determines which color to make the player based on their team assignment (which happens when they enter the lobby), and sets up all the other things player objects can do like boosting their speed, sending out a flare to locate the flag, etc.

```javascript
Player = function (game, team, position, flag, game_id, id) {
    this.alive = true;
    this.game = game;
    if(team === 'Blue'){
        this.player = game.add.sprite(blue_position[position][0], blue_position[position][1], 'blue_player', 'blue_team');
        this.team_flag = 'blue_flag';
    }else{
        this.player = game.add.sprite(red_position[position][0], red_position[position][1], 'red_player', 'red_team');
        this.team_flag = 'red_flag';
    }
    this.player_id = game_id;
    this.unique_id = id;
    this.flare = game.add.weapon(10, 'flare');
    this.flare.bulletKillType = Phaser.Weapon.KILL_LIFESPAN;
    this.flare.bulletLifespan = 1000;
    this.flare.bulletSpeed = 300;
    this.flare.fireRate = 300;
    this.flare.trackSprite(this.player, 0, 0, true);
    this.boost = 0;
    this.boostTurn = 0;

    this.player.scale.setTo(0.35, 0.35);

    this.player.anchor.set(0.5, 0.5);

    game.physics.p2.enable(this.player);

};
```
This is where we put the Socket.io factory inside the Angular controller so Angular has access to it. Below are a couple of functions initializing the sockets as soon as a player arrives at the home page, and then updating a playerList array once they signed in and entered the lobby before the game starts.

```javascript
gameApp.controller('mainController', function($scope, $http, $cookies, $route, $location, $rootScope, $timeout, socket){
  var num_ready = 0;
  var apiPath = 'http://localhost:3000';

  socket.on('player_init', function(socket_id){
    console.log("Welcome, fool", socket_id);
    myId = socket_id;
  });

  function updateLobbyCount(){
    for(var i = 0; i < playerList.length; i++){
      if(playerList[i].socketID == myId){
        var lobbyPlayer = playerList[i];
      }
    }
    socket.emit('enter_lobby', {
      id: myId,
      player: lobbyPlayer
    });
    console.log('someone is entering the lobby');
  }
```

Socket.io JavaScript that actually starts the game when all the players in the lobby have clicked the 'Game Launch' button. This initializes the game, sets up the randomly moving flag and creates all the players on the board when it's loaded. 

```javascript
socket.on('init_game', function(data){
    console.log(data.num_ready, users.length);
    if(data.num_ready == users.length){
      console.log("users are ready");
      io.sockets.emit('game_launch', users);
        console.log('game launching');
      flag_x = Math.floor(Math.random() * 1900 + 10);
      flag_y = Math.floor(Math.random() * 1900 + 10);
      io.sockets.emit('flag_coord', {
        flag_x:flag_x,
        flag_y:flag_y
      });
    }else{
      io.sockets.emit('player_ready', data.num_ready);
        console.log('no launch yet'); 
    }
  })
  ``` -->
